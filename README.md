# Feature-Selection-of-Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-using-Genetic-Algorithm
This is a university project at College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Fall 2021.
The original project was to do a feature selection over the Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. We had to test the F1 score of selecting every possible number of features using a Metaheuristic Algorithm which I used Genetic Algorithm for this purpose.
